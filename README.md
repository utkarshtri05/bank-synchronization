# bank-synchronization
This project is an HTML/JS demo of bank transaction synchronization. It shows how multiple withdrawals from a single account behave differently with and without locks. The example highlights race conditions vs synchronized execution, making it easier to understand concurrency concepts in a simple, visual way.
